Hi this is a repository from which you can get code and work on it .
you can get all sorts of code here like a calculatore which i have been working on. Also about that please tell me what I can add to this . 
i have made this repository for some people who want a sort of code tempalate on which you can work on . So, enjoy using this code for Free! As i keep adding code to this there will be lot's of templates. This is a new repository (8-5-2025) so there will be less code
